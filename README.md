#Simple Node API Server

Simple RESTful api that can handle CRUD for cats. 
Returns JSON data and logs some some stuff to the console. This project
is using pre-commit and eslint to make sure I follow some standards.

I have used the following:
- node.js _6.9.1_
- express _4.0.0_ (Node Framework) 
- mongoose _3.6.13_ (ORM)
- body-parser _1.0.1_ (allows me to pull POST content request)
- MongoDB
